# mcp-server-server

This repo is a proof of concept MCP server that lets you spin up ... another MCP server running a handful of servers.

## Background

Right now MCP servers are a little bit cumbersome to use, since most all of them operate over the stdio input/output protocol.
It would be nicer if you could spin up a remote environment that exposed these MCP servers.

## Running it
